# Agile

**What is Agile?** - A more modern and iterative method of project management
in the workplace

**What is SCRUM?** - An agile methodology designed for quick development of
small portions of a project in short succession within a time period referred
to as a sprint.

**The Scrum Process**
- **Product Backlog** - A longer "to-do" list for the entire project. What still needs to be completed?
- **Sprint Planning** - A meeting planning out the focus of the next sprint, including its backlog
- **Sprint Backlog** - The tasks that are going to be completed during the coming sprint
- **Daily Scrum** - Short meeting at the start of each day covering the team's blockers for their tasks and what they've covered so far
- **Review and Retrospective** - Two separate meetings at the end of each sprint - one with the project manager, the other within the sprint team - covering any issues or flaws with the completed sprint
- **Increment**  - The sum of all product backlog tasks completed during the sprint

**Scrum Roles**
- **Product Owners** - Key stakeholders that has a deep understanding of the product and communicates with the scrum team and other stakeholders
- **Scrum Master** - Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, faculty meetings, and removes impediments
- **Scrum Team** - 3-9 individuals working together to reach all the items in the sprint backlog.

**Scrum Artifacts**
- **Product Backlog** - All the tasks that lead towards the definition of done for the final product
- **Sprint Backlog** - The tasks intended to achieve during a coming sprint
- **Increment** - All the tasks completed during a single sprint
